## 📜 Project Description  

This RPG game allows players to create and interact with characters in a virtual world 🌍. Player data—such as status, inventory, and game progress—is automatically saved using the `pickle` library, ensuring data persistence across sessions 💾.  

The project is organized using the MVC architecture, which separates system responsibilities into three components:  

- **Model (Data Layer)**: Manages the game’s data and logic, such as characters, attributes, and inventory. ⚙️  
- **View (User Interface)**: Handles user interactions by displaying information and capturing player input. 🎮  
- **Controller (Logic Layer)**: Connects the model and view, managing game logic and player actions. 🤖

The goal is to create an immersive experience where players can develop their character 🧙‍♂️, explore the world, battle enemies ⚔️, and save their progress to continue their journey in future sessions.
